### Key Features of a GitHub Repository:

- Collaboration – Work with multiple contributors simultaneously.
- Issues & Pull Requests – Report bugs, request features, and review code changes.
- Branching & Merging – Develop new features without affecting the main code.
- GitHub Actions – Automate workflows like testing and deployment.
- Security & Permissions – Control who can view and modify your repository.
